# Architecture

A reference for how this site is actually built. Written for the maintainer (me, in six months) so a small change doesn't require re-reading the whole build. Start with `docs/BUILD.md` if you want the command surface first.

The public-facing version of this is the `Building this site` series on the colophon. This document is the internal companion: more mechanical, more file paths, fewer essays.

---

## 1. Philosophy in one paragraph

Node standard library only. A small `lib/` of single-purpose modules behind a `build.js` CLI. Plain HTML out. Content is markdown with frontmatter. CSS is hand-written, token-driven, in three layers. JavaScript is small enhancers, one file per concern. Deploy is GitHub Pages, triggered by a single workflow on push to `main`. If something looks complicated, it's worth questioning.

The core rules:

- **No npm dependencies.** There is no `package.json` at all — nothing to install, so CI runs `node build.js` directly.
- **No bundler, no framework.** Source files ship.
- **No build-time code splitting, no client-side router.** The browser asks for `/notes/` and the server returns `dist/notes/index.html`.
- **The build never destroys its own output.** Pages are written over the existing `dist/`, and stale files are pruned only after a complete run. An interrupted build leaves a working site. See `docs/BUILD.md` for why that rule exists.

  dist/                        built site, written fresh per build
```

`dist/` is gitignored in spirit but currently committed (so GitHub Pages doesn't have to rebuild). The CI workflow always overwrites it.

---

## 3. The build pipeline

The build runs in three phases, and they are separable on purpose — `docs/BUILD.md`
explains why (short version: a single indivisible build doesn't survive being
killed on a phone).

### 3.1 Scan — `lib/manifest.js`

Walks every input directory once and writes `.cache/manifest.json`: each content
file, layout, component, stylesheet, script, JSON config and standalone asset,
with its size and mtime. No parsing, no rendering. Run on its own with
`node build.js scan`.

Nothing downstream lists a directory again — `render` works from this list. That
matters because `readdir` is the call most likely to fail or come back empty in a
sandboxed runtime, and this is now the one place it happens, with counts printed.

### 3.2 Derive — `lib/context.js`

Parses everything the manifest names and computes every field the page modules
share, in one pass:

1. Read the site/nav/about/now/learning/gear/colophon JSON.
2. Render drawer + footer HTML from `nav.json` (see §10) onto `site.drawerNavHtml`
   and `site.footerNavHtml`.
3. Pre-render the fragments the template engine can't produce itself — work
   highlights, learning resource lists, gear items — because `{{#each}}` doesn't
   nest.
4. Parse the nine content collections (`lib/parse/content.js`).
5. Derive per-collection fields: product URL hosts, cultural ledes, reading status
   labels, movie star ratings, article routes and tag lists.
6. Partition articles into `essays`, `studies` and `buildSeries` by `kind` (§5.1).
7. Group articles by `series:` (§11), and group notes by month.

The result is one `ctx` object. **Every page group receives a fully-derived
context**, which is what lets any group run alone, in any order, in its own
process.

### 3.3 Render — `lib/commands/render.js` + `lib/pages/`

Walks the group registry in `lib/pages/index.js`, checkpointing to
`.cache/state.json` after each group:

| Group | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| `assets` | `dist/css/style.css`, `dist/js/main.js`, `feed.xsl` |
| `home` | `/` |
| `notes` | `/notes/` and `/notes/<slug>/` |
| `writing` | `/essays/`, `/studies/`, their tag pages and readers |
| `series` | `/build/<slug>/` |
| `projects` | `/projects/`, `/projects/cat/<slug>/`, per-project readers |
| `flat` | `/now/`, `/about/`, `/learning/`, `/gear/`, `/colophon/`, `/styles/` |
| `enjoying` | the five cultural kinds, plus the paginated `/enjoying/` |
| `products` | `/products/` and product readers |
| `feeds` | `/feed.xml` plus ten per-section Atom feeds |

Order is presentation order, not dependency order — it only buys a readable log.

Each group also declares an `inputs` array naming the manifest sections it reads
(`['notes']`, `['articles']`, `['css', 'js', 'assets']`, …). That's what lets
`node build.js step` rebuild the group your edit actually touched rather than
restarting at the top; `lib/pages/index.js` maps changed sections to affected
groups, treating `layouts`, `components` and `data` as affecting everything.

Outputs go through the writer in `lib/fsx.js`, which skips files whose bytes
already match and records everything it wrote. Stale files are pruned at the end,
and only when every group finished.

Total runtime: ~90ms on a laptop for a full build; a content edit typically
rewrites two or three files and reports the other sixty as unchanged.

### 3.4 Two things that are NOT what they look like

- **CSS and JS are not globbed.** `lib/config.js` holds explicit ordered lists.
  The cascade depends on `tokens` → `kit` → `site`, and `theme.js` must run first
  so the stored colour scheme applies before paint. A glob would sort them
  alphabetically and break both, silently. Adding a file means adding it to the
  list. (An earlier version of this document claimed otherwise. It was wrong.)
- **`src/assets/` is not copied wholesale.** `icons.svg` is inlined as a sprite
  during derive; product images are copied individually by the `products` group.

---

## 4. Content model

### 4.1 Frontmatter

Every `.mdx` file opens with YAML between two `---` lines. The parser handles strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays of objects (for `toc:`). Common fields:

| Field | Used by | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `slug` | All | URL segment. Required. |
| `title` | All | Display title. |
| `summary` | Most | One-sentence dek under the title. |
| `date` | Articles, notes | Human date like `01 January 2026`. |
| `read` | Articles | Reading time, e.g. `5 min`. |
| `kind` | Articles | `Essay`, `Study`, or `Build series`. Routes the page. |
| `tag1`, `tag2`, `tag3` | Articles, projects | Up to three tags. Used in indexes + filters. |
| `toc` | Articles | Array of `{id, label}` for the in-page TOC. |
| `series` | Articles | Series label (any string). Triggers series UI. |
| `seriesPart` | Articles | Order within the series (number). |
| `category` | Projects | One of `Code`, `Design`, `Accessibility`, `Hardware`, `Experiments`. |
| `status` | Projects | `In progress` / `Ongoing` / `Maintained` / `Shipped` / `Paused`. |
| `month` | Notes | Used to group notes in the index. |
| `context` | Notes | Italic kicker beneath the body. |
| `image` | Notes | URL for an image note. |
| `imageAlt` | Notes | Required when `image` is set. |
| `caption` | Notes | Optional caption beneath the image. |

### 4.2 MDX components

Four custom tags are recognised in article bodies. Each maps to `src/components/<Name>.html` with `{{prop}}` placeholders.

- `<Dropcap text="…" />` — display-typeface initial on the opening paragraph.
- `<Pullquote text="…" cite="…" />` — bordered quote with attribution.
- `<PullquoteNoCite text="…" />` — same, no attribution.
- `<MarginaliaPin text="…" />` — small note in the right gutter on wide viewports.

To add a new component: drop `src/components/<Name>.html` with the placeholders, then reference it as `<Name prop="value" />` in MDX. No code change needed — `lib/parse/components.js` loads whatever is in that directory.

### 4.3 Notes can be text or image

A note's body is text by default. If the frontmatter has `image:` (and `imageAlt:`), the row renders a `<figure>` instead. If both an `image:` and a body are present, the first body paragraph becomes the caption.

---

## 5. Article kinds and routing

`kind:` in article frontmatter drives where the page lives.

| `kind:` | Route | Index |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `Essay` (default) | `/essays/<slug>/` | `/essays/` |
| `Study` | `/studies/<slug>/` | `/studies/` |
| `Build series` | `/build/<slug>/` | linked from `/colophon/` |

Build-series posts also carry `series: "Building this site"` and `seriesPart: 1..5`, which triggers the series UI. They use the same article layout (`article.html`) and the same `buildWritingReader` function — only the directory and the back-link change.

---

## 6. The template engine

`renderTemplate(template, data)` lives in `lib/render/template.js`. Three constructs, three passes, each looped until stable — with an iteration cap, so a value that expands to text containing its own placeholder fails loudly instead of hanging.

### 6.1 Constructs

```handlebars
{{key}}                          simple substitution
{{a.b.c}}                        nested path
{{#each list}}…{{/each}}         loop
{{#if key}}…{{/if}}              conditional
```

That's the whole syntax. No filters, no partials, no escaping helpers. Whatever needs to be more complex is done in JS and passed in as an already-rendered HTML string.

### 6.2 Three passes

1. **`{{#each}}`**, innermost first, looped until no `each` blocks remain.
2. **`{{#if}}`**, same shape — innermost first, looped until stable.
3. **`{{key}}` / `{{a.b.c}}`**, looped until output stops changing.

The two looping properties exist for real reasons:

- **Nested `{{#if}}` requires innermost-first.** A naive non-greedy regex grabs the first `{{/if}}` it sees, which is the inner close on a nested block, leaving the outer close orphaned. Inside notes/image conditionals this was visibly broken; the fix is the regex pattern `(?:(?!\{\{#if\s)[\s\S])*?` for the body and a `do…while` that keeps re-running until the output stops changing.
- **Looping the simple-key pass** is what makes injected HTML resolve transitively. The drawer is built from `nav.json` as an HTML string containing `{{basePath}}`, then injected into pages via `{{drawerNavHtml}}`. Without the loop, `{{basePath}}` would ship literally to the browser. (This caused the `%7B%7BbasePath%7D%7Dnotes/` URL leak.)

---

## 7. The markdown parser

`parseMarkdown(md)` is a line-by-line state machine. Handles:

- Headings (`# … ######`) — `id` slugified from the text so TOC anchors work.
- Paragraphs.
- Unordered lists (`-` or `*`).
- Blockquotes (`> `).
- Horizontal rules (`---`).
- Fenced code blocks (` ``` `), with optional language tag. Content is HTML-escaped before being emitted inside `<pre><code class="language-xxx">…</code></pre>`.
- Inline: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `[link](url)`.
- Raw HTML / JSX-style component tags at the start of a line — emitted verbatim so block components don't get wrapped in `<p>`.

What it doesn't handle: ordered lists, nested lists, tables, images, footnotes (those use `<Footnote>` component shorthand instead), reference-style links.

---

## 8. CSS architecture

Three files, concatenated into `dist/css/style.css` at build time.

### 8.1 `tokens.css` — foundations

- **Palette**, in OKLCH, with semantic aliases (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`, etc).
- **Type scale**, sizes named `--t-h1` through `--t-micro`.
- **Spacing scale**, `--s-1` through `--s-11` in 4/8px steps.
- **Radii**, `--r-1` through `--r-card`.
- **Shadows**, mostly `none` in this design.
- **Motion** (`--ease-out`, `--dur-fast`).
- **Paper grain SVG** in `--paper-noise` and `--paper-flecks`.

Dark mode overrides the same custom properties under `[data-theme="dark"]`.

### 8.2 `kit.css` — components

The reusable patterns: `.btn`, `.tag`, `.kicker`, `.input`, `.essay-card`, `.project-tile`, `.note-item`, `.site-nav`, `.site-footer`, `.subscribe-card`, `.reader`. BEM-ish: `.essay-card__title`, `.note-item__figure`. No utility classes.

### 8.3 `site.css` — page-specific

The hero, the page header, sections, the grids, per-page blocks (CV, work history, podcasts grid, music shelf, movie diary), the drawer, the series nav, the build-series list, the code block surface, the paper grain layers (`body::before`, `body::after`), the glass nav.

### 8.4 Code blocks

`--bg-code` is a separate token from `--bg-sunken` (slightly darker warm cream / slightly lighter warm ink). Inline `code` and `pre` both sit on this surface. `pre` gets a hairline border and a 3px `--accent-soft` left rule. No syntax highlighting.

### 8.5 Paper grain

Two fixed full-viewport layers behind everything, `body::before` (broad grain) and `body::after` (sparse darker flecks). Driven by SVG `feTurbulence` + `feComponentTransfer` to threshold the alpha into discrete specks. Opacity is controlled by `--grain-opacity`, written every frame by `texture.js` from smoothed scroll velocity, so the grain dims during scroll and breathes back when motion stops. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` hides the layers entirely.

### 8.6 Glass nav

`.site-nav` is a full-width sticky strip with `backdrop-filter: blur(14px) saturate(140%)` over a 62% translucent `--bg`. Content stays in the 720px column via a `.site-nav__inner` wrapper. A `.site-nav::after` band just below the bar runs its own smaller `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` with a top-to-bottom mask, so content scrolling under the bar passes through a soft blur ramp instead of a hard line.

---

## 9. JavaScript

Each file is wrapped in an IIFE, attaches its listeners on `DOMContentLoaded`, and bails early if the elements it expects aren't on the page. All files are concatenated into `dist/js/main.js` at build time.

### 9.1 `theme.js`

Reads `dwt-theme` from `localStorage`, sets/removes `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`. Toggle button is `#theme-toggle`. Applies the theme synchronously before `DOMContentLoaded` to avoid a flash.

### 9.2 `nav.js`

Wires `#menu-open` to open `#site-menu-dialog` (the drawer), marks background siblings `inert`, focuses the dialog heading, traps tab focus, closes on `Esc` or `#menu-close`. Bails if `#menu-open` is missing.

### 9.3 `tag-filter.js`

On any index page with `[data-tags]` items and a `.filter-bar`, filters by tag without a reload.

### 9.4 `texture.js` — paper-grain fade

Samples scroll velocity per event, exponentially smooths it (`SMOOTH_IN`), and writes `--grain-opacity` on `<body>` each animation frame. A `requestAnimationFrame` loop decays the smoothed velocity (`SMOOTH_OUT`) once events stop. The grain dims toward `MIN_OPACITY` during motion and eases back to 1 over a few seconds.

Tunables at the top of the file:

```js
var MIN_OPACITY = 0.3;
var VEL_TO_FADE = 0.3;
var SMOOTH_IN = 0.06;
var SMOOTH_OUT = 0.97;
```

Bails entirely if `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

### 9.5 `accessibility.js`, `floorboards.js`

Reserved placeholders. Kept so the concat order stays stable.

---

## 10. Nav configuration (`nav.json`)

The single source of truth for what appears in the drawer and the footer. Each item has an `enabled` flag.

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "writing",
      "label": "Writing",
      "items": [
        { "label": "Notes",   "href": "notes/",   "note": "Fragments",     "enabled": true  },
        { "label": "Essays",  "href": "essays/",  "note": "The long ones", "enabled": false }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "footerExtras": [
    { "label": "RSS",   "href": "feed.xml" },
    { "label": "Email", "href": "mailto:{{email}}" }
  ]
}
```

`lib/render/nav.js`'s `renderDrawerNav()` and `renderFooterNav()` walk the groups, filter by `enabled`, and emit HTML containing `{{basePath}}` (which the template engine resolves per-page). A group with zero enabled items is dropped entirely so no orphan headings appear.

Pages still build whether or not they're in the nav — disabling a route only removes it from the menus. Direct URLs continue to work, so deferred pages can be shared as preview links.

The current launch set is **Home, Now, Notes, About, Colophon**. Everything else is `"enabled": false`.

---

## 11. The series concept

Series is a structural relationship between articles — parts of one piece. Distinct from `tags` (topical) and the related-articles block ("you might also like").

Any article can opt into a series:

```yaml
series: "Building this site"
seriesPart: 3
```

Articles sharing a `series:` value are grouped and sorted by `seriesPart`. The article reader for a series article gets two new blocks:

- **Series TOC** at the top of the body — every part listed, current marked with "You are here" and rendered as a non-link.
- **Prev/Next** at the bottom — walks the series linearly, omits prev on first part and next on last.

When an article is in a series, the existing related + read-next blocks are suppressed. The series replaces them.

Build series posts (`kind: "Build series"`) all set `series: "Building this site"`. Future essays can use the same machinery for any multi-part piece.

---

## 12. Deploy

Single workflow file at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. On push to `main`:

1. Checkout.
2. Install Node 20.
3. `node build.js` (no `npm install` first — there's nothing to install).
4. Upload `dist/` as a Pages artifact.
5. Deploy the artifact to Pages.

Typical end-to-end: ~35 seconds. Build itself is sub-second.

No dependency cache (nothing to cache). No preview deploys (no fork PRs). No CI link/a11y/Lighthouse check (audited manually). No CDN-purge step (Pages handles it).

---

## 13. Common tasks

### 13.1 Add an essay

```
src/content/articles/NN-my-essay.mdx
```

Frontmatter: `slug`, `kind: Essay`, `title`, `summary`, `date`, `read`, optional `tag1/2/3`, optional `toc`. Run `node build.js`. New page appears at `/essays/<slug>/`.

To make it visible in the launch nav, also flip `Essays` to `"enabled": true` in `nav.json`.

### 13.2 Add a note (text or image)

```
src/content/notes/NN-my-note.mdx
```

Text note: `slug`, `date`, `month`, `title`, optional `context`, body in markdown.

Image note: same plus `image:` (URL), `imageAlt:`, optional `caption:`. Body is optional.

### 13.3 Add a project

```
src/content/projects/NN-my-project.mdx
```

Frontmatter: `slug`, `title`, `summary`, `kind: Project`, optional `category` (Code/Design/Accessibility/Hardware/Experiments), `status`, `year`, `tag1/2/3`. Lands at `/projects/<slug>/` and appears on `/projects/`. With a category set, also appears on `/projects/cat/<slug>/`.

### 13.4 Change a colour or type token

Edit the relevant custom property in `src/css/tokens.css`. The dark-mode override under `[data-theme="dark"]` lives in the same file.

### 13.5 Flip a nav item on or off

Edit `enabled` in `src/content/nav.json`. Build.

### 13.6 Add a new series

In each piece of the series, set `series: "Series name"` and `seriesPart: N`. The series UI appears automatically; no code change needed.

### 13.7 Add a new MDX component

Create `src/components/<Name>.html` with `{{prop}}` placeholders. Reference it as `<Name prop="value" />` in any MDX body.

### 13.8 Tune the paper grain

Two SVG tokens in `tokens.css`: `--paper-noise` (broad) and `--paper-flecks` (sparse darker specks). Both use a `feComponentTransfer` discrete table to threshold the alpha. More non-zero entries = denser. Higher peak values = stronger specks. Light + dark have separate definitions.

### 13.9 Tune the grain's scroll fade

Tunables at the top of `src/js/texture.js`: `MIN_OPACITY`, `VEL_TO_FADE`, `SMOOTH_IN`, `SMOOTH_OUT`. CSS transition on the layers is 180ms linear — the JS smoothing is what makes the fade gradual.

---

## 14. Known quirks and lessons

- **Template engine needs to loop simple substitutions.** An interpolation that injects HTML containing further `{{...}}` placeholders won't resolve in one pass. `renderTemplate` repeats each pass until the output stops changing — capped at 50 iterations, so a genuinely circular value throws with the stuck placeholder named instead of spinning forever.
- **Never delete `dist/` at the start of a build.** The build used to open with `fs.rmSync(DIST, …)`. Killed at 100ms, that left 13 of 64 files on disk and no way to tell why. Outputs now go through `lib/fsx.js`, which writes over the existing site and prunes stale files only after a complete run.
- **A module that runs work at import time will run it twice.** `build.js` used to call `build()` on load *and* export it, so `serve.js`'s `require('./build')` started one build and its explicit call started another — both deleting `dist/`. Anything with side effects needs a `require.main === module` guard.
- **`fs.watch(… { recursive: true })` is not universally available.** It throws `ERR_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE_ON_PLATFORM` or `ENOSYS` where the platform can't back it. `serve.js` catches that and falls back to mtime polling over the manifest.
- **A CLI that only accepts characters the user's keyboard won't produce has a bug.** iOS autocorrect turns `--` into an em dash, so every flag typed on a phone was silently dropped — `render --group notes` became a full 64-file build with no indication anything had gone wrong. `lib/args.js` normalises the Unicode dashes, the run log names any non-ASCII character by codepoint, and the common commands (`step`, `resume`, `render <group>`) need no flag at all.
- **An incremental command has to rebuild what you changed, not what comes first.** `step` originally walked the registry in presentation order, so editing a note rebuilt the CSS bundle and left the note alone. Each group in `lib/pages/` now declares an `inputs` array naming the manifest sections it reads, and `step` renders the most specific affected group first (fewest inputs wins, so `notes` beats `home`, which merely digests notes).
- **Don't hide diagnostic files in a dot-directory.** `build.log` and `build-status.txt` started life in `.cache/`, where a file browser hid them — so the fallback channel added for a broken terminal was itself invisible. They live at the repo root now; `.cache/` keeps only machine state.
- **Nested `{{#if}}` and `{{#each}}` need innermost-first matching.** A negative lookahead `(?:(?!\{\{#if\s)[\s\S])*?` in the body of the regex pattern restricts each match to a block without further nesting; loop until stable.
- **CSS grid `1fr` carries implicit `min-width: min-content`.** An image inside a grid cell expands the cell to the image's intrinsic width unless you use `minmax(0, 1fr)` and put `min-width: 0` on the body cell. This bit the image-note row.
- **Fixed-position noise behind moving content triggers motion sickness.** The grain fade in `texture.js` is not cosmetic — it's an accessibility default, with a hard opt-out under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **GitHub Pages CDN can hold the previous version at the edge for a few minutes** after a deploy. If something looks wrong right after a push, hard-refresh and wait before debugging.
- **Don't put hashed filenames on `style.css` / `main.js`** unless you also expose a stable alias. Stable URLs are how the site can be referenced from external tools (Figma code layers, embeds) without rewriting.

## 15. The reading order

If a new person inherits this repo, the order I'd hand them:

1. This file.
2. `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`.
3. `docs/BUILD.md`, then `lib/commands/render.js` → `lib/context.js` → `lib/pages/index.js`.
4. `src/css/tokens.css`, then `kit.css`, then `site.css`.
5. The Build series essays at `/build/building-this-site-N-…/`.

Total reading time: about an hour. After that they should be able to fix anything in here without asking.
